1. Write a program to sort an array of 5 integers using Bubble Sort.
Input: 5 2 9 1 3
Output: 1 2 3 5 9

2. Modify Bubble Sort to sort an array in descending order instead of ascending.
Example:
Input → 3 8 1 6 2
Output → 8 6 3 2 1

3. Count the total number of swaps performed during Bubble Sort.
Example:
Input → 5 1 4 2 8
Output → Sorted array: 1 2 4 5 8
Total swaps: 4

4. Implement optimized Bubble Sort (stop early if no swaps occur in a pass).
Print how many passes it took to fully sort the array.

Example:
Input → 1 2 3 4 5
Output →

Array sorted in 1 pass.
Sorted array: 1 2 3 4 5

5. Write a Bubble Sort program that sorts floating-point numbers.
Example:
Input → 4.2 1.1 3.5 2.7
Output → 1.1 2.7 3.5 4.2

6. Use Bubble Sort to arrange characters alphabetically.
Example:
Input → ['d', 'a', 'c', 'b']
Output → ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

7. Modify Bubble Sort to sort only a specific range (e.g., between index 2 and 6).
Example:
Input → [9, 3, 8, 1, 4, 7, 2]
Sort only from index 2 to 6 → [9, 3, 1, 2, 4, 7, 8]

Read this Code:


students = {
"Ali": {"age": 20, "grade": "A"},
"Sara": {"age": 19, "grade": "B"},
"Usman": {"age": 21, "grade": "A"}
}

# Update Sara's grade and add a new student
students["Sara"]["grade"] = "A+"
students["Hina"] = {"age": 22, "grade": "B"}
